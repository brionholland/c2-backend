These are the directions for building drmingw for use within
COSMOS to catch segfaults and provide useful Ruby debugging
information on Windows

Required:
1. Ruby Installed and in your path
2. Ruby Devkit installed but not yet in your path

Steps:
1. Download and extract drmingw-0.6.4.zip from:
    https://github.com/jrfonseca/drmingw/releases
2. Copy the patched CMakeLists.txt and exchndl.c files into drmingw-0.6.4/src
3. Make a new directory from the mingw base called build and change to it
  mkdir build
  cd build
3. Add devkit to your path by running:
    C:\Devkit\devkitvars.bat
    or
    C:\Devkit64\devkitvars.bat
4. In the drmingw-0.6.4 build directory run from a cmd prompt:
    cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DRUBY_LIBRARY:STRING=C:\\Ruby21\\bin\\msvcrt-ruby210.dll -DDLLTOOL=C:\\Devkit\\mingw\\bin\\dlltool.exe ..
    or
    cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DRUBY_LIBRARY:STRING=C:\\Ruby21-x64\\bin\\x64-msvcrt-ruby210.dll ..
5. The above step will fail due to sh being in your path
6. Close and reopen the command prompt
7. In the drmingw-0.6.4 build directory run from a cmd prompt:
    cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DRUBY_LIBRARY:STRING=C:\\Ruby21\\bin\\msvcrt-ruby210.dll -DDLLTOOL=C:\\Devkit\\mingw\\bin\\dlltool.exe ..
    or
    cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DRUBY_LIBRARY:STRING=C:\\Ruby21-x64\\bin\\x64-msvcrt-ruby210.dll ..
8. Add devkit to your path by running:
    C:\Devkit\devkitvars.bat
    or
    C:\Devkit64\devkitvars.bat
9. Compile:
    mingw32-make
10. Copy build/bin/exchndl.dll and build/bin/mgwhelp.dll (or build/bin/mgwhelp-x64.dll) to cosmos bin folder
s11. Rename exchndl.dll to exchndl21.dll or exchndl21-x64.dll based on the version of ruby used to compile
12. Repeat with the other versions of Ruby if necessary
